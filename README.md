# Cumulocity LWM2M Demo client
This repository contains a demo implementation of the [eclipse Leshan client](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan) for **Cumulocity IoT**. The leshan client demo sends temperature values and supports location tracking and device controls. In the following it will be shown how to easily connect and use the demo client with Cumulocity IoT.

Cumulocity is an IoT platform that enables rapid connections of numerous different devices and applications. It allows you to monitor and respond to IoT data in real time and to spin up this capability in minutes. More information on Cumulocity IoT and how to start a free trial can be found [here](https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/product/cumulocity-iot.html#/).

Cumulocity IoT enables companies to quickly and easily implement smart IoT solutions.

The [Cumulocity IoT documentation](https://cumulocity.com/guides/protocol-integration/lwm2m/) contains detailed instructions on how to connect LWM2M devices to the platform.

## Getting started

Before the demo client can be connected to the platform, the *endpoint ID* and *URI* definition in the registration and docker-compose file need to be configured for the bootstrapping process.

### registration.csv

In the registration.csv file, the fields for *endpoint ID* and *lwm2m server URI* must be checked. Make sure that the endpoint ID is unique and hasnâ€™t been used before to register a device. Additionally, the lwm2m server URI needs to contain the right hosting environment: coap://lwm2m.**eu-latest.cumulocity.com**:5783

### docker-compose.yaml

Edit the docker-compose.yaml and change the endpoint ID and URI in the environment variables for all containers so that they match the entries in the registration file.

```
version: "4.3"
services:
  lwm2m_client_1:
    build:
      context: leshan-demo-client
      args:
        ENDPOINT: "**lwm2m_device01**" 
        URI: "lwm2m.**eu-latest.cumulocity.com**"
...
```

## Upload device protocols to Cumulocity IoT

The leshan demo client uses the following LWM2M objects: 3 (device), 6 (location), 3303 (temperature sensor), 3441 (lwm2m test object).

Cumulocity allows any LWM2M objects to be easily interfaced with the platform and supports out-of-the-box integration for the standard LWM2M objects 3(device), 4(connectivity), 5(firmware) and 6(location).

Upload the xml resource files to Cumulocity in the **Device Management -> Device types -> Device protocols** tab.

The leshan demo client sends a random temperature measurement at 3303/5700. To add the functionality, open the 3303 protocol and turn on **Send measurement** for the Sensor Value. Make sure to enable on **Auto observe** for at least one functionality per protocol.

The LWM2M objects 3 (device) and 6 (location) don't need a mapping since the objects are supported out-of-the-box.

## Define LWM2M post-registration actions
LWM2M shell commands can be performed in the Shell tab of each device. It is also possible to execute some common operations when a device sends a full registration request.
In this example the LWM2M post operations will be used the read the current device info (3) and location (6) from the device, if the devices sends a registration request.
To do this go to the tab **Device Management -> Device types -> LWM2M post-operations** and add the following:
 ```
read /3
read /6
 ```

## Device registration

To register a LWM2M device in Cumulocity IoT, upload a CSV file with registration data in the bulk registration dialog in **Device Management -> Devices -> Registration -> Register device -> LWM2M (Bulk Registration)**.

Start the demo clients with 

```
docker-compose up
```

Further information on how to read and send events, alarms or custom actions from LWM2M devices or how to write to LWM2M objects can be found in the [Cumulocity IoT documentation](https://cumulocity.com/guides/protocol-integration/lwm2m/).
